Here is the code developed during the January 16 meeting of the Portland Ethereum / Blockchain Developers group.  Please be aware that if you run this d'app using MetaMask pointed at the mainnet, you will incur real ether gas charges and will affect your PortCoin balance (if you click transfer).

This requires that you have nodejs installed.  See here for instructions: https://nodejs.org/

To run it should be as simple as:

```
npm install
npm start
```
